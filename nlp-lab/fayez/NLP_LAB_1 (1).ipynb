      "Although the earliest machine learning model was introduced in the s when Arthur Samuel invented a program that calculated the winning chance in checkers for each side the history of machine learning roots back to decades of human desire and effort to study human cognitive processes In  Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb published the book The Organization of Behavior in which he introduced a theoretical neural structure formed by certain interactions among nerve cells Hebbs model of neurons interacting with one another set a groundwork for how AIs and machine learning algorithms work under nodes or artificial neurons used by computers to communicate data Other researchers who have studied human cognitive systems contributed to the modern machine learning technologies as well including logician Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch who proposed the early mathematical models of neural networks to come up with algorithms that mirror human thought processes\n",

      "As a scientific endeavour machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence AI In the early days of AI as an academic discipline some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods as well as what were then termed neural networks these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalised linear models of statistics Probabilistic reasoning was also employed especially in automated medical diagnosis\n",
      "However an increasing emphasis on the logical knowledgebased approach caused a rift between AI and machine learning Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation By  expert systems had come to dominate AI and statistics was out of favour Work on symbolicknowledgebased learning did continue within AI leading to inductive logic programmingILP but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper in pattern recognition and information retrieval Neural networks research had been abandoned by AI and computer science around the same time This line too was continued outside the AICS field as connectionism by researchers from other disciplines including John Hopfield David Rumelhart and Geoffrey Hinton Their main success came in the mids with the reinvention of backpropagation\n",
      "Machine learning ML reorganised and recognised as its own field started to flourish in the s The field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature It shifted focus away from the symbolic approaches it had inherited from AI and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics fuzzy logic and probability theory\n",
      "There is a close connection between machine learning and compression A system that predicts the posterior probabilities of a sequence given its entire history can be used for optimal data compression by using arithmetic coding on the output distribution Conversely an optimal compressor can be used for prediction by finding the symbol that compresses best given the previous history This equivalence has been used as a justification for using data compression as a benchmark for general intelligence\n",

      "Machine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly but while machine learning focuses on prediction based on known properties learned from the training data data mining focuses on the discovery of previously unknown properties in the data this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases Data mining uses many machine learning methods but with different goals on the other hand machine learning also employs data mining methods as unsupervised learning or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy Much of the confusion between these two research communities which do often have separate conferences and separate journals ECML PKDD being a major exception comes from the basic assumptions they work with in machine learning performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge while in knowledge discovery and data mining KDD the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge Evaluated with respect to known knowledge an uninformed unsupervised method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods while in a typical KDD task supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data\n",
      "Machine learning also has intimate ties to optimisation Many learning problems are formulated as minimisation of some loss function on a training set of examples Loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances for example in classification one wants to assign a label to instances and models are trained to correctly predict the preassigned labels of a set of examples\n",
