      "Machine learning ML reorganised and recognised as its own field started to flourish in the s The field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature It shifted focus away from the symbolic approaches it had inherited from AI and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics fuzzy logic and probability theory\n",
      "There is a close connection between machine learning and compression A system that predicts the posterior probabilities of a sequence given its entire history can be used for optimal data compression by using arithmetic coding on the output distribution Conversely an optimal compressor can be used for prediction by finding the symbol that compresses best given the previous history This equivalence has been used as a justification for using data compression as a benchmark for general intelligence\n",

      "Machine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly but while machine learning focuses on prediction based on known properties learned from the training data data mining focuses on the discovery of previously unknown properties in the data this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases Data mining uses many machine learning methods but with different goals on the other hand machine learning also employs data mining methods as unsupervised learning or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy Much of the confusion between these two research communities which do often have separate conferences and separate journals ECML PKDD being a major exception comes from the basic assumptions they work with in machine learning performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge while in knowledge discovery and data mining KDD the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge Evaluated with respect to known knowledge an uninformed unsupervised method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods while in a typical KDD task supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data\n",
      "Machine learning also has intimate ties to optimisation Many learning problems are formulated as minimisation of some loss function on a training set of examples Loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances for example in classification one wants to assign a label to instances and models are trained to correctly predict the preassigned labels of a set of examples\n",
