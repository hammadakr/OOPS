      "Although the earliest machine learning model was introduced in the s when Arthur Samuel invented a program that calculated the winning chance in checkers for each side the history of machine learning roots back to decades of human desire and effort to study human cognitive processes In  Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb published the book The Organization of Behavior in which he introduced a theoretical neural structure formed by certain interactions among nerve cells Hebbs model of neurons interacting with one another set a groundwork for how AIs and machine learning algorithms work under nodes or artificial neurons used by computers to communicate data Other researchers who have studied human cognitive systems contributed to the modern machine learning technologies as well including logician Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch who proposed the early mathematical models of neural networks to come up with algorithms that mirror human thought processes\n",

      "As a scientific endeavour machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence AI In the early days of AI as an academic discipline some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods as well as what were then termed neural networks these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalised linear models of statistics Probabilistic reasoning was also employed especially in automated medical diagnosis\n",
      "However an increasing emphasis on the logical knowledgebased approach caused a rift between AI and machine learning Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation By  expert systems had come to dominate AI and statistics was out of favour Work on symbolicknowledgebased learning did continue within AI leading to inductive logic programmingILP but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper in pattern recognition and information retrieval Neural networks research had been abandoned by AI and computer science around the same time This line too was continued outside the AICS field as connectionism by researchers from other disciplines including John Hopfield David Rumelhart and Geoffrey Hinton Their main success came in the mids with the reinvention of backpropagation\n",
      "Machine learning ML reorganised and recognised as its own field started to flourish in the s The field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature It shifted focus away from the symbolic approaches it had inherited from AI and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics fuzzy logic and probability theory\n",
      "There is a close connection between machine learning and compression A system that predicts the posterior probabilities of a sequence given its entire history can be used for optimal data compression by using arithmetic coding on the output distribution Conversely an optimal compressor can be used for prediction by finding the symbol that compresses best given the previous history This equivalence has been used as a justification for using data compression as a benchmark for general intelligence\n",

      "Machine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly but while machine learning focuses on prediction based on known properties learned from the training data data mining focuses on the discovery of previously unknown properties in the data this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases Data mining uses many machine learning methods but with different goals on the other hand machine learning also employs data mining methods as unsupervised learning or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy Much of the confusion between these two research communities which do often have separate conferences and separate journals ECML PKDD being a major exception comes from the basic assumptions they work with in machine learning performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge while in knowledge discovery and data mining KDD the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge Evaluated with respect to known knowledge an uninformed unsupervised method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods while in a typical KDD task supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data\n",
      "Machine learning also has intimate ties to optimisation Many learning problems are formulated as minimisation of some loss function on a training set of examples Loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances for example in classification one wants to assign a label to instances and models are trained to correctly predict the preassigned labels of a set of examples\n",

      "The black box theory poses another yet significant challenge Black box refers to a situation where the algorithm or the process of producing an output is entirely opaque meaning that even the coders of the algorithm cannot audit the pattern that the machine extracted out of the data The House of Lords Select Committee which claimed that such an intelligence system that could have a substantial impact on an individuals life would not be considered acceptable unless it provided a full and satisfactory explanation for the decisions it makes\n",
      "In  a selfdriving car from Uber failed to detect a pedestrian who was killed after a collision Attempts to use machine learning in healthcare with the IBM Watson system failed to deliver even after years of time and billions of dollars invested Microsofts Bing Chat chatbot has been reported to produce hostile and offensive response against its users\n",
      "Machine learning has been used as a strategy to update the evidence related to a systematic review and increased reviewer burden related to the growth of biomedical literature While it has improved with training sets it has not yet developed sufficiently to reduce the workload burden without limiting the necessary sensitivity for the findings research themselves\n",
      "Explainable AI XAI or Interpretable AI or Explainable Machine Learning XML is artificial intelligence AI in which humans can understand the decisions or predictions made by the AI It contrasts with the black box concept in machine learning where even its designers cannot explain why an AI arrived at a specific decision By refining the mental models of users of AIpowered systems and dismantling their misconceptions XAI promises to help users perform more effectively XAI may be an implementation of the social right to explanation\n",
      "Settling on a bad overly complex theory gerrymandered to fit all the past training data is known as overfitting Many systems attempt to reduce overfitting by rewarding a theory in accordance with how well it fits the data but penalising the theory in accordance with how complex the theory is\n",
      "Learners can also disappoint by learning the wrong lesson A toy example is that an image classifier trained only on pictures of brown horses and black cats might conclude that all brown patches are likely to be horses A realworld example is that unlike humans current image classifiers often do not primarily make judgements from the spatial relationship between components of the picture and they learn relationships between pixels that humans are oblivious to but that still correlate with images of certain types of real objects Modifying these patterns on a legitimate image can result in adversarial images that the system misclassifies\n",
      "Adversarial vulnerabilities can also result in nonlinear systems or from nonpattern perturbations For some systems it is possible to change the output by only changing a single adversarially chosen pixel Machine learning models are often vulnerable to manipulation or evasion via adversarial machine learning\n",
      "Researchers have demonstrated how backdoors can be placed undetectably into classifying eg for categories spam and wellvisible not spam of posts machine learning models that are often developed or trained by third parties Parties can change the classification of any input including in cases for which a type of datasoftware transparency is provided possibly including whitebox access\n",
      "Classification of machine learning models can be validated by accuracy estimation techniques like the holdout method which splits the data in a training and test set conventionally  training set and  test set designation and evaluates the performance of the training model on the test set In comparison the Kfoldcrossvalidation method randomly partitions the data into K subsets and then K experiments are performed each respectively considering  subset for evaluation and the remaining K subsets for training the model In addition to the holdout and crossvalidation methods bootstrap which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset can be used to assess model accuracy\n",
      "In addition to overall accuracy investigators frequently report sensitivity and specificity meaning true positive rate TPR and true negative rate TNR respectively Similarly investigators sometimes report the false positive rate FPR as well as the false negative rate FNR However these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators Receiver operating characteristic ROC along with the accompanying Area Under the ROC Curve AUC offer additional tools for classification model assessment Higher AUC is associated with a better performing model\n",
      "\n",
      "The ethics of artificial intelligence covers a broad range of topics within AI that are considered to have particular ethical stakes This includes algorithmic biases fairness automated decisionmaking accountability privacy and regulation It also covers various emerging or potential future challenges such as machine ethics how to make machines that behave ethically lethal autonomous weapon systems arms race dynamics AI safety and alignment technological unemployment AIenabled misinformation how to treat certain AI systems if they have a moral status AI welfare and rights artificial superintelligence and existential risks\n",
      "Different machine learning approaches can suffer from different data biases A machine learning system trained specifically on current customers may not be able to predict the needs of new customer groups that are not represented in the training data When trained on humanmade data machine learning is likely to pick up the constitutional and unconscious biases already present in society\n",
      "Systems that are trained on datasets collected with biases may exhibit these biases upon use algorithmic bias thus digitising cultural prejudices For example in  the UKs Commission for Racial Equality found that St Georges Medical School had been using a computer program trained from data of previous admissions staff and that this program had denied nearly  candidates who were found to either be women or have nonEuropean sounding names Using job hiring data from a firm with racist hiring policies may lead to a machine learning system duplicating the bias by scoring job applicants by similarity to previous successful applicants Another example includes predictive policing company Geoliticas predictive algorithm that resulted in disproportionately high levels of overpolicing in lowincome and minority communities after being trained with historical crime data\n",
      "While responsible collection of data and documentation of algorithmic rules used by a system is considered a critical part of machine learning some researchers blame lack of participation and representation of minority population in the field of AI for machine learnings vulnerability to biases In fact according to research carried out by the Computing Research Association CRA in  female faculty merely make up  of all faculty members who focus on AI among several universities around the world Furthermore among the group of new US resident AI PhD graduates  identified as white  as Asian  as Hispanic and  as African American which further demonstrates a lack of diversity in the field of AI\n",
      "Language models learned from data have been shown to contain humanlike biases Because human languages contain biases machines trained on language corpora will necessarily also learn these biases In  Microsoft tested Tay a chatbot that learned from Twitter and it quickly picked up racist and sexist language\n",
      "In an experiment carried out by ProPublica an investigative journalism organisation a machine learning algorithms insight into the recidivism rates among prisoners falsely flagged black defendants high risk twice as often as white defendants In  Google Photos once tagged a couple of black people as gorillas which caused controversy The gorilla label was subsequently removed and in  it still cannot recognise gorillas Similar issues with recognising nonwhite people have been found in many other systems\n",
      "Because of such challenges the effective use of machine learning may take longer to be adopted in other domains Concern for fairness in machine learning that is reducing bias in machine learning and propelling its use for human good is increasingly expressed by artificial intelligence scientists including FeiFei Li who said that theres nothing artificial about AI Its inspired by people its created by people andmost importantlyit impacts people It is a powerful tool we are only just beginning to understand and that is a profound responsibility\n",
      "There are concerns among health care professionals that these systems might not be designed in the publics interest but as incomegenerating machines This is especially true in the United States where there is a longstanding ethical dilemma of improving health care but also increasing profits For example the algorithms could be designed to provide patients with unnecessary tests or medication in which the algorithms proprietary owners hold stakes There is potential for machine learning in health care to provide professionals an additional tool to diagnose medicate and plan recovery paths for patients but this requires these biases to be mitigated\n",
      "Since the s advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks a particular narrow subdomain of machine learning that contain many layers of nonlinear hidden units By  graphics processing units GPUs often with AIspecific enhancements had displaced CPUs as the dominant method of training largescale commercial cloud AI OpenAI estimated the hardware compute used in the largest deep learning projects from AlexNet  to AlphaZero  and found a fold increase in the amount of compute required with a doublingtime trendline of  months\n",
      "Tensor Processing Units TPUs are specialised hardware accelerators developed by Google specifically for machine learning workloads Unlike generalpurpose GPUs and FPGAs TPUs are optimised for tensor computations making them particularly efficient for deep learning tasks such as training and inference They are widely used in Google Cloud AI services and largescale machine learning models like Googles DeepMind AlphaFold and large language models TPUs leverage matrix multiplication units and highbandwidth memory to accelerate computations while maintaining energy efficiency Since their introduction in  TPUs have become a key component of AI infrastructure especially in cloudbased environments\n",
      "Neuromorphic computing refers to a class of computing systems designed to emulate the structure and functionality of biological neural networks These systems may be implemented through softwarebased simulations on conventional hardware or through specialised hardware architectures\n",
      "A physical neural network is a specific type of neuromorphic hardware that relies on electrically adjustable materials such as memristors to emulate the function of neural synapses The term physical neural network highlights the use of physical hardware for computation as opposed to softwarebased implementations It broadly refers to artificial neural networks that use materials with adjustable resistance to replicate neural synapses\n",
      "Embedded machine learning is a subfield of machine learning where models are deployed on embedded systems with limited computing resources such as wearable computers edge devices and microcontrollers Running models directly on these devices eliminates the need to transfer and store data on cloud servers for further processing thereby reducing the risk of data breaches privacy leaks and theft of intellectual property personal data and business secrets Embedded machine learning can be achieved through various techniques such as hardware acceleration approximate computing and model optimisation Common optimisation techniques include pruning quantisation knowledge distillation lowrank factorisation network architecture search and parameter sharing\n",
